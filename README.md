# hakaiR

## Introduction

The purpose of this package is to:

* facilitate collaborative development of custom functions for summarizing and analyzing Hakai data;
* produce versioned sets of data and functions to ensure analytical reproducibility;
* serve as a formal framework for open science data sharing, collaboration, and contribution

As new articles and functions are available, this package will be updated and new versions will be released. Check back to see if the package is updated before starting or finalizing an analysis. In the Changelog section of this website you can find release notes about changes to the package functions and data.

If you would like to suggest improvements, features, or bug fixes to this package please do so at https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/hakair/issues. If you would like to modify any part of this package you are encouraged to submit a pull request. If neither of those previous statements make much sense to you then I'll point you to the [Hakai Institute Guide for Reproducible Analyses](https://hecate.hakai.org/rguide/#) which outlines many of the collaborative data science workflows this R package is premised on.
